# 1.0 Project Task Analysis

## 1.1 Project Name

The name of the project is "**University Comprehensive Community**". The system is suitable for teachers and students of various universities to find information online, publish articles and socialize, etc.

## 1.2 Main Purpose of the project

Provide a social question and answer website for schools, improve the learning efficiency of teachers and students, and improve the efficiency of communication. This type of website is a question-and-answer SNS website between an encyclopaedia and traditional Q & A. It is a public knowledge platform, and its value lies in rebuilding the relationship between people and information. Users ask questions and other users answer. The Q & A service expands broad keywords into clear questions and realizes the conversion of information to knowledge through constant revision by users.

## 1.3 Project Phase Analysis

### 1.3.1 Stage 1- Background research and Requirement Analyse 

1. By understanding the current situation and shortcomings of traditional Q & A websites, a preliminary analysis of the functional requirements of the system is made.
2. Make a questionnaire and distribute it on campus to learn about the habits of users and the status of self-study. There are 50 copies. Data were collected through questionnaires.
3. Randomly select a user for a face-to-face interview. Specify 4-5 main questions about self-study for interviews and invite users to answer. Record the results of the interview for later analysis.
4. Perform a step-by-step analysis of the collected data. First, analyse the data obtained from the questionnaire to determine user needs, and then analyse the interviews to obtain data. Finally, combined with the conclusions of the questionnaire survey and interviews, determine the exact user needs.

### 1.3.2 Stage 2- Program Development

1. First analyse user needs in combination with actual conditions, and discuss what technology is used to implement each requirement after the analysis is complete.
2. After completing most of the requirements, the code will be integrated and sent to the user, and the user will suggest modifications through the experience system.
3. Changes in requirements at any time during development

### 1.3.3 Stage 3- Test 

1. Unit tests are performed after not completing a module
2. Integration tests will be performed after the modules are brought together
3. Complete usability testing before submitting the system to users
4. After the system is submitted to the user, the user's internal test is first performed.
5. Perform all usability tests, stress tests, etc. in a real network environment

### 1.3.4 Stage 4- Deployed

After all development work and testing work are completed, the project will be deployed in a real network environment.

## 1.4 Background research

### 1.4.2 Field research

Field research is an effective research method. Before you start designing your system, you need to interview users and record the data you are investigating. Then you need to experience as much as possible of the full functionality of the existing question answering system. This is to facilitate the development of the system, avoid repetitive errors, and provide better services for school teachers and students.

### 1.4.3 Questionnaire

The questionnaire survey is a first-hand survey method. The questionnaire survey is a very effective way to obtain user needs. After subsequent data analysis, you can quickly and accurately obtain the needs of a large number of users. At this stage, it is necessary to avoid restrictions on user needs. Each questionnaire requires collection of 35 valid data. For the final analysis phase, I first need to summarize the data of each questionnaire and analyse them one by one to determine the initial functional requirements.

## 1.5 Analysis of research results

### 1.5.1 Analysis for Second-hand Research 

Investigate the status of existing Q & A communities and user feedback via the Internet.

After investigation found, the comprehensive Q & A community for universities is very scarce, and some companies have directly stopped the Q & A service (eg Google). Other types of Q & A communities only include some basic functions, and the functions that can be achieved are relatively single, and most of them only implement the functions of asking and answering questions. On the other hand, in terms of user search results, there are also limitations to what can be searched. Of course, the most important point is that this type of system is for global users, and the user range and user quality cannot be effectively controlled. In addition, the users of some systems are more targeted users and cannot be used by anyone (such as stackoverflow).

Through the above analysis, it can be shown that there is a vacancy in the Q & A community market for universities, which is feasible for developing such systems.

### 1.5.2 Analysis for Field research

After in-depth use of the Quorar system and understanding of all its functions, the following conclusions were reached.

- **Functional aspects**
  1. The features of the Quora system are relatively comprehensive, especially in terms of asking questions and answering questions. When users ask questions, the system standardizes the way users ask questions and sets tags for questions posted by users. The advantage of this is that users can accurately search for relevant solutions when querying problems.
  2. Quora has also established many discussion groups to allow users with the same preferences to communicate in the same discussion area. This approach will undoubtedly increase user usability and loyalty to the system.
  3. At the beginning of new user registration, the system supports third-party account logins, reducing the hassle of users creating multiple accounts. Users only need to have one account to log in to other platforms. Secondly, when a new user logs in for the first time, the system will ask the user to choose their preferences and the discussion group they want to join. These practices fully demonstrate the powerful functions of the system for user division and management.

- **User experience**

  Quora has a very clear display page, user self-management module and issue preview function. These indicate that Quora's human-computer interaction is well done, and it is worth quoting in project development.

- **Content aspect**
  1. Because Quora has many groups, the content displayed on the homepage is too cluttered, and it cannot quickly locate the problems that users are interested in or the problems to be solved.
  2. There is no specific retrieval method for the content of the questions answered by the user, which results in that the solution searched by the user is not 100% accurate, and the user needs to judge the solution by himself.

### 1.5.3 Analysis for Questionnaire

A total of 50 questionnaires were distributed and 50 were recovered, of which 47 were valid data.

**Q1:** The data obtained from the survey shows that the users participating in the survey are evenly distributed, so the survey data can be used as a reference

![](https://github.com/Ma-Zhuang/Pic/blob/master/Q1.PNG?raw=true)

**Q2: **Through data analysis, when users encounter learning difficulties, the first solution they use is a search engine (40% of the total), followed by a Q & A system (36%). Ask classmates or teachers to find solutions that account for 10% and 12%, respectively. It can be seen that most users still prefer to search for solutions to problems through the Internet.

![](https://github.com/Ma-Zhuang/Pic/blob/master/Q2.PNG?raw=true)

**Q3:** When users search for answers through the Internet, only a few of them can find useful information (forty-eight percent), and only a small number of users can query the Internet for accurate solutions.

![](https://github.com/Ma-Zhuang/Pic/blob/master/Q3.PNG?raw=true)

**Q4:** When it comes to whether a professional mentor is required to solve a professional problem, the intentions of the users appear to be particularly consistent. Among them, 96% of the users want professional mentors to coach professional problems, and almost no one is unwilling.

![](https://github.com/Ma-Zhuang/Pic/blob/master/Q4.PNG?raw=true)

**Q5:** Among the user groups who ask teachers, most users can't get in touch with their mentors quickly and easily when they contact the teachers on weekends or breaks to answer questions. (60%) Even a small percentage of users with 16% cannot contact the mentor, and only 24% of users can contact the teacher at any time.

![](https://github.com/Ma-Zhuang/Pic/blob/master/Q5.PNG?raw=true)

**Q6:** The data collected through the sixth question shows that the questions that the user most wants to ask as a questioner are mainly professional-related questions and solutions corresponding to professional questions. Secondly, users are keen to ask questions about knowledge points, learning routes, and employment.

![](https://github.com/Ma-Zhuang/Pic/blob/master/Q6.PNG?raw=true)

**Q7:** Data on what caused the user to abandon the use of the question and answer system. Almost all users will abandon the system due to factors such as fees and the quality of the solution to the problem.

![](https://github.com/Ma-Zhuang/Pic/blob/master/Q7.PNG?raw=true)

**Q8:** Through data analysis, it is known that users most want to obtain useful information on the Q & A system, such as professional answers to professional questions, learning routes, recommended learning methods, and the latest related industry consulting.

![](https://github.com/Ma-Zhuang/Pic/blob/master/Q8.PNG?raw=true)

**Q9: For the user experience of the existing Q & A apps and Q & A platforms, what are you most satisfied with / are you least satisfied with?**

- **Positive**
  1. Has a large number of distributions, providing users with more than the relevant knowledge of the profession.
  2. Provide third-party account login to reduce the hassle of remembering account and passwords.
  3. Categorize questions for easy query
- **Negative**
  1. Search results have a lot of duplicates
  2. The content of the solution is called clutter, and you cannot find an accurate solution quickly.

**Q10:What features do you want in a complete Q  A system**

1. Blog
2. Online communication
3. Industry Information
4. Tutors participate in Q & A

  2. Every day must complete the goals of the day.

- **Time-based** 

  1. Submit Trello Board on time every Monday at 12 noon.
  2. Feedback to users, timely modification.

## 1.8 Development Approach 

- **Development Language** 

  1. Language comparison

     The syntax is similar to C language, so programmers who have learned C language can quickly become familiar with PHP development. And java needs to learn java's syntax and familiar with some core class libraries, and understand object-oriented programming methods. So java is not as easy to learn as php.

     Java must first be compiled into a bytecode .class file, and then interpreted and executed on the Java virtual machine. The first easiest way to think of Java's Web development is JSP (now to JSP2.0). The original Java Web development was used, so JSP appeared later. JSP can be easily embedded in HTML files. When executed on the server, it is first converted into a servlet by the application server, and then compiled and executed. Jsp can generate powerful features through servlet and JavaBean support. JavaBean is a replaceable, cross-platform software component. Using javabean can easily achieve the separation of java code and html, which can enhance the system's functionality and software overlap.

     And all aspects of Java Web development are included in J2EE, such as: JSP, Servlet, JDBC, JNDI, JAVABEAN, EJB, etc. J2EE is particularly suitable for large enterprise applications

  2. Database access comparison

     Java accesses the database through JDBC, and easily accesses the database through database drivers provided by different database vendors. The interface to access the database is relatively uniform.

     PHP uses different database access interfaces for different databases, so the universality of database access code is not strong. For example: Web applications developed in Java need to be modified from MySQL database to Oracle database. PHP requires a lot of modification.

  3. Comparison of system design architectures

     Using Java's Web development technology, it is necessary to use an object-oriented system design method, while PHP still uses a process-oriented development method. Therefore, a lot of system analysis and design work needs to be done in the early stage of development with Java.

  4. Cross-platform

     Both Java and PHP have good cross-platform features. Almost all can run on different operating systems such as Linux or Windows without any modification.

  5. Comparison of distributed multilayer architectures

     PHP can only implement a simple distributed two-tier or three-tier architecture, while JAVA is more powerful in this respect and can implement a multi-layer network architecture. The database layer (persistence layer), application (business) logic layer, and presentation logic layer are separated from each other, and now different layers have been supported by some mature development frameworks. For example, Struts uses Java's Web development technology to implement the MVC design pattern. There is also a Spring framework in the business logic layer, and Hibernate and other frameworks in the database persistence layer. These frameworks can facilitate developers to efficiently, rationally and scientifically structure multi-tier business applications.

  6. Source code security

     The source code of programs developed by PHP is public, and others can modify the programs developed by PHP.

     The program developed by Java, in the end, the user gets only some compiled class classes, and cannot see the complete source code, which is highly secure.

  7. Performance comparison

     In the loop performance test, it took amazing four seconds to end the 20,000 * 20000 loop. The PHP test was 2000 * 2000 cycles (an order of magnitude less), but took 63 seconds each.
     In the database test, the two performed 1000 inserts, updates, selects, and deletes on Oracle 8 respectively: JSP takes 13 seconds, and PHP takes 69 seconds.

     | Activity                 | PHP                        | JAVA              |
     | ------------------------ | -------------------------- | ----------------- |
     | Reusability              | Low                        | High              |
     | Development speed        | High                       | Low               |
     | Maintainability          | Low                        | High              |

     | Safety                   | Low                        | High              |
     | Multi-layer architecture | Low                        | High              |

# 2.0 Project Management 

## 2.1 Gantt chart  

![](https://github.com/Ma-Zhuang/Pic/blob/master/%E6%8D%95%E8%8E%B7gantt.PNG?raw=true)

![](https://github.com/Ma-Zhuang/Pic/blob/master/%E6%8D%95%E8%8E%B7gantt2.PNG?raw=true)

## 2.2 Risk

According to the project's Gantt chart, its critical path is focused on design and analysis. This shows that the risk of this project lies in changes in user needs.

There are certain risks in determining user requirements and background research in the planning stage. In addition, there are risks in designing system models during the development stage. To reduce risk:

1. Find existing similar systems for functional analysis. Whenever possible, look for features with good user feedback. In short, take the essence and discard the dross.
2. When the user needs are obtained by issuing a questionnaire, some dirty data may be collected, which will affect the accuracy of the needs. Therefore, as many questionnaires as possible should be distributed when issuing the questionnaire to expand the scope of the collected data and reduce the impact of dirty data on the results.
3. When analysing and designing a system, there may be situations where developers do not understand the system requirements. Therefore, it is necessary to find similar functions in existing similar systems as much as possible, so as to increase development efficiency, reduce development direction errors, and ultimately perfectly realize user requirements.

## 2.3 Milestone 

|            Milestone Name            |    Deadline    |     Complete Content      |

|   Complete testing and deployment    |  May 8, 2020   |         Deployed          |

## 2.4 Approach 

This development uses the PRINCE2 method for project management. It is mainly product-oriented content. Reduce unnecessary work and speed up product realization.

The development is divided into three major phases: analysis phase, development phase, and deployment phase. The main work of the analysis phase is background investigation, identifying and analysing user needs, and its ultimate purpose is to determine the initial requirements of the project. After completing this phase, there will be a completed set of requirements reports. Secondly, the development phase is mainly to achieve the needs of users, and the integrity of the function can be achieved through testing. After the completion of a functional point in the development stage, a prototype system will be implemented to get user feedback, and then change the requirements to further approximate the user's real needs. Finally, the main purpose of the final deployment phase is to provide real-time experience for potential users and further obtain user feedback. And timely change the function to further improve the system availability.

## 2.5 MVP

The first version of the system basically realized all the user needs, but it was only implemented without optimization, UI and other details. The main purpose of the MVP model is to quickly obtain MDP (the system that users expect). During this period, multiple iterations are required to achieve the perfect system.

The basic functions of the MVP model of the system are as follows:

**Blog module**

Blog management

Comment response management

Like management

Full Text Search

**Q & A module**

Problem management

Comment response management

Like management

Full Text Search

**User module**

# 3.0 Verification & validation 

## 3.1 Internal Test

1. **Test Methods**

   - **Static test method**

     There is less application data in the test process. The main process is to complete the test process by manual inference or the correctness of the calculation methods and algorithms in the computer-aided test program. The advantage of this type of test is that it can be completed in a shorter time and with less resources Testing of software and software code can clearly find errors in such code.

   - **dynamics test**

     The main purpose of computer dynamic testing is to detect problems that occur during software operation. Compared with static testing methods, the reason why it is called dynamic is that its testing method mainly relies on the use of programs. Whether the software works well. The most obvious feature is that the software is running during dynamic testing. Only in this way can software defects be found during use, and then such defects can be repaired. Two types of factors can be included in the dynamic test process, namely the software under test and the data required for the test. The two types of factors determine the correct and effective development of the dynamic test.

   - **Black box test**

     Observe the data output through data input and check whether the internal function of the software is normal. When the test is unfolded, data is entered into the software and waits for data to be output. If the data output is consistent with the expected data, it proves that the software passes the test. If the data is different from the expected data, even if the difference is small, it also proves that there is a problem in the software program and it needs to be resolved as soon as possible.

   - **White box test**

     This type of testing method covers all types of code in the program, and covers a wide range, which is suitable for multi-type programs. After testing the unknown errors in the dynamic detection method, first use the black box detection method. If the program input data is the same as the output data, it proves that there is no problem with the internal data, and it should be analyzed from the code side. If there is a problem, use it. The white box test method analyzes the internal structure of the software until the problem is detected and modified in a timely manner.

2. Test strategy

   - **unit test**

     The advantage of this type of testing strategy is that it requires less analysis data and is more targeted. The program developer can determine the general area of the problem through operation experience during the development process, and then analyse the relevant units for such problems and carry out Troubleshoot.

   - **Integration Testing**

     For this system, the integration test method is more complicated than the unit test method, and it should be tested gradually. The incremental test method is a derivative of the integration test method. It can test the software in different orders. In the test, the two types of integration tests are performed, and then the selection is performed in order.

## 3.2 User test

1. **Usability test**

   The user really uses the software system, and the experimenter observes, records and measures the experimental process. So as to accurately feedback the performance of users and reflect their needs. During user testing, the developer observes and tests the user's actual use site. After the user test, the data obtained in the test needs to be compiled and summarized, such as the average time, median value, range, and standard deviation of the completion time, and the percentage of users who successfully completed the task. For a single interaction, the user makes a variety of different tendencies. Histogram representation etc. Then analyze the data and write a final test report based on the severity and urgency of the problem.
